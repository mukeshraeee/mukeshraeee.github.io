I am an atmospheric scientist specializing in air quality modeling and satellite data analysis. Currently, at **Baylor University**, I am developing high-resolution emission on-road emission inventories using the **EMFAC–MOVES** framework, focusing on link-level emissions in California’s San Joaquin Valley and utilizing **WRF-Chem** to quantify the impacts of non-exhaust emissions.

My work with **NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**—specifically within the Tropospheric Composition Group—involved introducing the **Trace Gas Atmospheric River (TGAR)** framework to track long-range pollution transport during extreme events. This research integrates **CrIS** satellite observations, reanalysis datasets (**TCR-2**, **MOMO-Chem**), and in-situ observations. Previously, I supported the **ICIMOD Atmospheric Watch Initiative**, where I contributed to the **NASA SERVIR** project to validate air quality models against measurements, i.e., satellite products and in-situ observations.
