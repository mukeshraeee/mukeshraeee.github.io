I recently completed my postdoctoral fellowship in the [Tropospheric composition group](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/mrai/) with [Vivienne Payne](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/vpayne/) and [Kazuyuki Miyazaki](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/kmiyazak/). My research at JPL focused on understanding air pollution using satellite observations, reanalysis products, and in-situ datasets. I investigated the extreme event of long-range transport processes, particularly by extending the atmospheric river concept to trace gases. I utilized tropospheric chemistry reanalysis and satellite data on carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (Oâ‚ƒ), and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) to identify and characterize large-scale transport events. My work aimed to improve the integration of satellite data into transport diagnostics, evaluate the accuracy of reanalysis products, and quantify the impact of long-range transport on regional and local air quality.

As of August 2025, I will join the Department of Environmental Science at Baylor University as a postdoctoral researcher. In this role, I am focusing on urban-scale air quality studies using chemical transport models, with the goal of better understanding pollution dynamics in cities, identifying emission sources, and supporting science-based air quality management strategies.
