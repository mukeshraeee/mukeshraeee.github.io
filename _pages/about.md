I am an atmospheric scientist specializing in air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and the transport of pollutants. At Baylor University, I develop greenhouse gas emission inventories using the EMFAC–MOVES framework, with a focus on link-level emissions in California’s San Joaquin Valley, and apply WRF-Chem to assess the impacts of non-exhaust emissions. At NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) — within the Tropospheric Composition Group — I introduced the Trace Gas Atmospheric River (TGAR) framework to track long-range pollution transport during extreme events. My research integrates satellite observations (CrIS), reanalysis datasets (TCR-2, MOMO-Chem), and in-situ measurements to validate key pollutants such as CO, O₃, and PANs. Previously, at ICIMOD, I contributed to the operationalization of NASA SERVIR air quality models and satellite products within the Atmospheric Watch Initiative (AWI) dashboard, enhancing regional air quality monitoring and greenhouse gas assessments.
