Currently, I am working as a postdoc fellow in [Tropospheric composition group](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/mrai/) with [Vivienne Payne](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/vpayne/) and [Kazuyuki Miyazaki](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/kmiyazak/) at JPL. I study air pollution using model simulations, satellite data, reanalysis, and observational datasets. My research focuses on air pollutants' spatial and temporal distribution, aerosol-boundary layer interactions, and long-range transport, especially extending the atmospheric river concept to trace gases. I am using tropospheric chemistry reanalysis and satellite data on CO, O$_3$, and PAN from NASA JPL to analyze large-scale trace gas transport. My goals are to improve satellite data used in transport analysis, assess the accuracy of reanalysis products, and quantify the impact of long-range transport on local air quality.
